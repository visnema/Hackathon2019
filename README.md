# Hackathon2019
A Team's BOT, which helps to cultivate diversity and inclusion principals within the team.  The BOT can join the meetings and will carefully listen to the conversation without interrupting. After the meeting BOT will analyze each and every individual who joined the conversation and will provide the constructive feedback to improve D&amp;I and also provide rewards wherever team did well. The BOT will do so, by analyzing the meeting on various aspects e.g. voice, tone, language, content, duration of speaker etc.
